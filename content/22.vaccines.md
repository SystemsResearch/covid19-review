## Vaccine Development Strategies for SARS-CoV-2

<!--To Do: Add back the Abstract & Importance, potentially with some editing-->

### Introduction

The development of vaccines is widely considered one of the most important medical advances in recent human history.
Over the past 150 years, the approaches available for the development of vaccines have diversified rapidly [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
Since the turn of the millennium, particular interest has emerged in the potential to develop vaccines as a rapid response to emerging threats.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the "swine flu" (H1N1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola all underscored the importance of a rapid global response to a new infectious virus, but the vaccine development process has historically been slow, and vaccines fail to provide immediate prophylactic protection or treat ongoing infections [@doi:10.3390/v10120680].
However, the _Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2_ (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has highlighted a confluence of circumstances that positioned vaccine development as a key player in efforts to control the virus and mitigate its damage.
Examining the vaccine development programs that emerged in 2020 alongside other 21st century efforts to control emerging viral threats demonstrates the significant biotechnological advances in this field.<!--To Do: awkward phrasing--> 

### Historical Vaccine Development
<!--To Do: This first paragraph could probably use a little fleshing out since a lot of it is based on one source, but just to give an idea-->
The first vaccination strategy in human history is widely considered to be the practice of variolation, which makes the history of vaccine development almost 500 years long [@doi:10.1016/j.jinf.2005.07.021; @doi:10.1007/978-1-4419-1339-5_2].
Famously employed as a strategy to improve survival of smallpox by, for example, exposing a healthy individual to pus from a smallpox pustule [@doi:10.1016/j.jinf.2005.07.021; @doi:10.1007/978-1-4419-1339-5_2], variolation carries a number of risks for the recipient [@doi:10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.032].
However, this approach was (debatably) the first example of a live-attenuated virus being used to induce immunity [@doi:10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.032; 10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
Many subsequent efforts to develop live-attenuated viral vaccines relied on either the identification of related zoonotic viruses that are less virulent in humans (e.g., cowpox/horsepox or rotavirus vaccines) or efforts to attenuate the virus through culturing it _in vitro_ [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
This approach still carried risks, however [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
Efforts to overcome the limitations of live-virus vaccines led to the development of approaches to inactivate viruses (circa 1900) and to purify proteins from viruses cultured in eggs (circa 1920) [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
Inactivated viral vaccines still raised some concerns, however, incuding that back-mutations could potentially lead the inactivated vaccines to become virulent or that recombination could occur between the inactivated virus and other viruses in circulation[@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].
Errors in the manufacturing process that produced polio vaccines containing live polio virus led to a polio outbreak in the United States [@doi:10.1056/NEJMp048180].
Additionally, one of the major limitations of inactivated whole virus vaccines is their susceptibility to lose efficacy due to mutations in the epitopes of the circulating virus [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].
With the increased feasibility of genetic research in the 1980s came the application of genetic engineering to vaccine development, which allowed for the growth of the gene sequences of specific viral antigens _in vitro_  [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
While vaccine development strategies such as live-attenuation and inactivation remain in use in the 21st century [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111], approaches built off of the principles of genetic engineering offer some of the most dynamic opportunities in the field of modern vaccine development.

### 21st Century Approaches to Vaccine Development

![
**Vaccine Development Strategies.**
Several different strategies can and are being employed for the development of vaccines today.
Each approach capitalizes on different features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and delivery through a different platform.
All of these approaches are being explored in the current pandemic.<!--To Do: define LNP, define mRNA, define S protein. Swap order so viral particles are on top, then DNA, then viral vector, then RNA panels?

](images/N002-Vaccines.png){#fig:vaccines secno=1}

While traditional methods of vaccine development such as inactivated whole viruses are still used today (Figure @fig:vaccines), biomedical research in the 21st century has been significantly influenced by the genomic revolution, and vaccine development is no exception.
Building on the advances in vaccine development that came out of genetic engineering starting in the 1980s, one approach to vaccine development today focuses on the information available in the DNA sequence of a virus (Figure @fig:vaccines).
In traditional DNA vaccines, the sequence encoding the antigen(s) against which an immune response is sought can be cultivated in a plasmid and delivered directly to an appropriate tissue [@url:https://www.who.int/biologicals/areas/vaccines/dna/en/].
Plasmids are not the only vector that can be used to deliver sequences associated with viral antigens: genetic material from the target virus can also be delivered using a second virus as a vector.
The genetic content of the vector virus is often altered to prevent it from replicating, but replication-competent viruses can also be used under certain circumstances [@doi:10.1016/j.coi.2016.05.014].
Once the plasmid or viral vector brings the DNA sequence to an APC, the host machinery can be used to construct antigen(s) from the transported genetic material, against which the body then synthesizes antibodies in response [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
These approaches may offer several advantages over vaccination platforms from before genetics became a staple of biomedical research because these vaccines can stimulate both B- and T-cell responses and lack any infectious agent [@doi:10.1016/j.coi.2016.05.008; @doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
Both of these approaches therefore utilize a vector to deliver the DNA sequence of an antigen to be constructed by the host, triggering an immune response to the antigen without introducing an infectious agent.

More recently, interest has also emerged the potential for viral RNA to induce an immune response (Figure @fig:vaccines).
This approach operates one level above the DNA: instead of directly furnishing the gene sequence associated with an antigen to the host, it provides the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribed from the DNA sequence.
<!--To Do: Two types, self-amplifying and conventional 10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594; 10.1016/j.coi.2016.05.008-->
Prior to 2020, no mRNA vaccines had been approved for use in humans<!--To Do: Cite-->, despite significant advances in the development of this technology [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2017.243].
Some of the potential advantages of mRNA compared to DNA include safety (it cannot be integrated by the host and the half life can be regulated), it avoids any issues of a host immune response against the vector, and it holds the potential to dramatically accelerate vaccine manufacturing and development [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2017.243].
Vaccine development using mRNA is a recent frontier, with challenges in its execution arising from the instability of mRNA molecules, the design requirements of an efficient delivery system, and the potential for mRNA to elicit a very strong immune response [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2017.243].
Current methods in vaccine development can therefore be framed in terms of the central dogma of genetics: vaccines developers are exploring the potential for the delivery of DNA (DNA vaccines and viral vector vaccines), RNA (mRNA vaccines), and proteins (inactivated whole virus vaccines) to induce a host immune response.

### The Pursuit of Rapid, Scalable Vaccine Development

The requirements for a successful vaccine trial and deployment are complex and may require coordination between government, industry, academia, and philanthropic entities [@doi:10.1126/science.abc5312].
The potential of this technology to benefit the field of oncology has encouraged vaccine developers to invest in next-generation approaches to vaccine development, which have led to the great diversity of vaccine development programs [@url:https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/newer-vaccine-technologies-deployed-to-develop-covid-19-shot-67152].
<!--To do: compare and contrast a few 21st century attempts to develop vaccines, SARS, MERS, ebola, and swine flu (which is below). What technologies were explored and why didn't they succeed?-->
Flu-like illnesses caused by viruses are a common target of vaccine development programs, and influenza vaccine technology in particular has made many strides.
During the H1N1 influenza outbreak, vaccine development was accelerated because of the existing infrastructure, along with the fact that regulatory agencies had already decided that vaccines produced using egg- and cell-based platforms could be licensed under the regulations used for a strain change.
Critiques of the production and distribution of the H1N1 vaccine have stressed the need for alternative development-and-manufacturing platforms that can be readily adapted to new pathogens.
Although a monovalent H1N1 vaccine was not available before the pandemic peaked in the United States and Europe, it was available soon afterward as a stand-alone vaccine that was eventually incorporated into commercially available seasonal influenza vaccines [@doi:10.1056/NEJMp2005630].
If H1N1 vaccine development provides any indication, considering developing and manufacturing platforms for promising COVID-19 vaccine trials early could hasten the emergence of an effective prophylactic vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.-->

### Challenges and Opportunities in Developing a Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 rapidly induced a global public health crisis.
This viral threat did not follow the same trajectory as other emergent viruses of recent note, such as SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and ebola virus, spreading internationally to the point that it was recognized as a pandemic and remaining largely out of control well into 2021.
While, for various reasons, the outbreak of this virus was not controlled as rapidly as in past epidemics, vaccine development technology had also progressed based on these and other prior viral threats to the point that a rapid international vaccine development response was possible.
The first critical step towards developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was characterizing the viral target, which happened extremely early in the COVID-19 outbreak with the sequencing and dissemination of the viral genome by early January 2020 [@url:https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/] (Figure @fig:virus).

![
**Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.**
The development of vaccines depends on the immune system recognizing the virus.
Here, the structure of SARS-CoV-2 is represented both in the abstract and against a visualization of the virion.<!--To Do: Add in-line ref-->
The abstracted visualization was made using BioRender [@url:https://biorender.com/] and the microscopy was done by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [@url:https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/novel-coronavirus-sarscov2-images].
](images/SARS_CoV_2.png){#fig:virus secno=1}

For a highly infectious virus like SARS-CoV-2, a vaccine would hold particular value because it could bolster the immune response to the virus of the population broadly, thereby driving a lower rate of infection and likely significantly reducing fatalities.
The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is coordinating global health agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As of September 2020, there were over 180 vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 in development [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2798-3].
While little is currently known about immunity to SARS-CoV-2, vaccine development typically tests for serum neutralizing activity, as this has been established as a biomarker for adaptive immunity in other respiratory illnesses [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2022483].
However, unlike in efforts to develop vaccines for prior viral threats, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic has made it possible to test vaccine in phase III trials, where the effect of the vaccine on a cohort's likelihood of contracting SARS-CoV-2 can be evaluated.
Unlike many global vaccine development programs previously, such as with H1N1, the vaccine development landscape for COVID-19 includes vaccines produced by a wide array of technologies.
These diverse technology platforms include DNA, RNA, virus-like particle, recombinant protein, both replicating and non-replicating viral vectors, live attenuated virus, and inactivated virus approaches (Figure @fig:vaccines).

### Live-Attenuated Viruses

<!--To Do: Not used this time I think?-->
Although this is the vaccine development strategy with the longest history... (short paragraph explaining not really in play here)

### Inactivated Whole-Virus Vaccines

Another well-established technology, inactivated whole-virus vaccines, is under development against SARS-CoV-2.
This platform has been a valuable tool in efforts to control many viruses, and some well-known whole virus vaccines targets include influenza viruses, poliovirus, and hepatitis A virus.
These types of vaccines use full virus particles that have been rendered non-infectious by chemical (i.e. using formaldehyde or &beta;-propiolactone [@doi:10.1080/14760584.2017.1357471]) or physical (i.e. heat) means.
Though these virus particles are inactivated, they still have the capacity to prime the immune system.
The size of the virus particle makes it ideal for uptake by APC, which leads to stimulation of helper T-cells [@doi:10.1038/nri2868].
Additionally, the array of epitopes on the surface of the virus increases antibody binding efficiency [@doi:10.1038/nri2868].
The native conformation of the surface proteins, which is also important for eliciting an immune response, is preserved using these techniques.
Membrane proteins, which support B-cell responses to surface proteins, are also included using this method [@doi:10.1084/jem.164.4.1114].
Overall, these vaccines are able to mimic the key properties of the virus that stimulate a robust immune response, but the risk of adverse reactions is reduced because the virus is inactivated and thus unable to replicate.

<!--To Do: Were these investigated for SARS, MERS, ebola, H1N1?-->

One prominent inactivated whole-virus vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is being developed by Sinovac, a Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company.
Their CoronaVac vaccine uses an inactivated whole virus with the addition of an aluminum adjuvant [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2020.585354] and is currently in Phase III clinical trials in Brazil [@doi:10.1186/s13063-020-04775-4].
<!--To Do: Expand slightly (1-2 sentences) on how it is made -- how do they inactivate it?-->
Phase I and II clinical trials indicated a strong immunogenic response in animal models and the development of neutralizing antibodies in human participants [@doi:10/fx8z; @doi:10.1126/science.abc1932; @doi:10/fpcx].
<!--To Do: Check if there are any specifics available about immunogenicity that we can compare across vaccines...-->
Safety analysis of the vaccine during the phase II trial revealed that most adverse reactions were either mild (grade 1) or moderate (grade 2) in severity.<!--To Do: check this, original text said "all" but that is in conflict with 2 lines below-->
The most common symptom was pain at the injection site (9%) and fever (3%), and only 2% (n=7) of participants participants reported severe adverse events, though these were determined to be unrelated to the vaccine.
While data from the phase III study will be required to evaluate the efficacy of the virus under real-world conditions of exposure, the current results suggest that this vaccine is likely to adapt a well-established approach to vaccine development for the prevention of COVID-19.

CoronaVac has been approved for use in China and has been granted emergency use in Azerbaijan, Brazil, Cambodia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and Uruguay [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html#sinovac].<!--To Do: clean citation-->
Sinovac has reported that their platform now has the capacity to provide up to a billion doses [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html#sinovac].<!--To Do: clean citation-->
<!--To Do: A sentence or two comparing to Sinopharm (2 candidates), https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7561304/ BBIBP-CorV; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32778225/ --->
The Sinopharm-Beijing Institute vaccine is currently approved for use in Bahrain, China, and the United Arab Emirates, but has been granted emergency use in Argentina, Cambodia, Egypt, Guyana, Hungary, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Nepal, Pakistan, Peru, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe, with limited use in both Serbia and the Seychelles [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html#sinopharm].<!--To do: clean citation-->
In contrast, the Sinopharm-Wuhan vaccine, which has been approved for use in China since February 25th, 2021, has been distributed almost exclusively within China, with limited supplies distributed to the United Arab Emirates [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html#wuhan].<!--To Do: clean citation-->
<!--To Do: This should be slower to produce, I think? How does this compare to other platforms?-->
Delays in vaccine distribution have also caused issues, particularly in Turkey where 10 million doses of Sinovac were due to arrive by December 2020, but instead only 3 million were delivered in early January [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/25/business/china-covid-19-vaccine-backlash.html].
Similar delays and shortages of doses promised have been reported by officials in the Philippines, Egypt, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates [@url:https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/philippines-receive-covid-19-vaccine-delays-76163594; @url:https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-covid-19-vaccine-makers-struggle-to-meet-demand-11612958560].
This will be concerning to China who have vaccine contracts for millions of doses with Indonesia (>100 million), Brazil (100 million), Chile (60 million), Turkey (50 million), Egypt (40 million) and many others [@url:https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-covid-19-vaccine-makers-struggle-to-meet-demand-11612958560].

### DNA Vaccines

The delivery and presentation of antigens is fundamental to inducing immunity against a virus such as SARS-CoV-2.
DNA vaccines offer an approach to delivering foreign substances into the body in a way that induces both a humoral and cellular immune response [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].

#### DNA Vaccines Vectored with Plasmids

<!--To Do: Plasmid DNA vaccines for other 21st century epidemics, and the coming-of-age of this technology in the late 00s-->

<!--To Do: Add background on how the INO-4800 vaccine is designed-->
Currently, a Phase I safety and immunogenicity clinical trial of INO-4800, a prophylactic vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, is underway [@clinicaltrials:NCT04336410].
The vaccine developer Inovio Pharmaceuticals Technology is overseeing administration of INO-4800 by intradermal injection followed by electroporation with the CELLECTRA® device to healthy volunteers.
Electroporation is the application of brief electric pulses to tissues in order to permeabilize cell membranes in a transient and reversible manner.
It has been shown that electroporation can enhance vaccine efficacy by up to 100-fold, as measured by increases in antigen-specific antibody titers [@doi:10.1016/j.coi.2011.03.008].
The safety of the CELLECTRA® device has been studied for over seven years, and these studies support the further development of electroporation as a safe vaccine delivery method [@doi:10.4161/hv.24702].
The temporary formation of pores through electroporation facilitates the successful transportation of macromolecules into cells, allowing cells to robustly take up INO-4800 for the production of an antibody response.
Approved by the United States (U.S.) FDA on April 6, 2020, the phase I study is enrolling up to 40 healthy adult volunteers in Philadelphia, PA at the Perelman School of Medicine and at the Center for Pharmaceutical Research in Kansas City, MO.
The trial has two experimental arms corresponding to the two locations.
Participants in Experimental Group 1 will receive one intradermal injection of 1.0 milligram (mg) of INO-4800 followed by electroporation using the CELLECTRA® 2000 device twice, administered at Day 0 and Week 4.
Participants in Experimental Group 2 will receive two intradermal injections of 1.0 mg (total 2.0 mg per dosing visit) of INO-4800 followed by electroporation using the CELLECTRA® 2000 device, administered at Day 0 and Week 4.
Safety data and the initial immune responses of participants from the trial are expected by the end of the summer of 2021.
The development of a DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 by Inovio could be an important step forward in the world's search for a COVID-19 vaccine.
Although exciting, the cost of vaccine manufacturing and electroporation may make scaling the use of this technology for prophylactic use for the general public difficult.

#### Viral-Vector Vaccines

Viral vectors have emerged as a safe and efficient method to furnish the nucleotide sequences of an antigen to the immune system using a second virus as a vector [@doi:10.1128/CVI.00298-16].
The vaccine then uses the host machinery to construct antigen(s) from the transported genetic material, for which the body synthesizes antibodies in response.
The genetic content of the vector virus is often altered to prevent it from replicating, but replication-competent viruses can also be used under certain circumstances [@doi:10.1016/j.coi.2016.05.014].
Viral-vector vaccines are able to induce both an antibody and cellular response; however, the response is limited due to the immunogenicity of the viral vector used [@doi:10.1016/j.coi.2011.03.006; @doi:10.1038/mt.2009.130].
Various viral-vector platforms including poxviruses [@doi:10/cnw6vw; @doi:10.4161/hv.28974], adenoviruses [@doi:10.1038/mt.2009.130], and vesicular stomatitis viruses [@pmid:10196265; @doi:10.1016/j.molmed.2004.03.003] are being developed,
An important consideration in identifying potential vectors is the immune response to the vector.
Both the innate and adaptive immune responses can potentially respond to the vector, limiting the ability of the vaccine to transfer information to the immune system [@doi:10.1038/gt.2009.148].
Different vectors are associated with different levels of reactogenicity; for example, adenoviruses elicit a much stronger innate immune response than replication deficient adeno-associated viruses derived from parvoviruses [@doi:10.1038/gt.2009.148].
Additionally, using a virus circulating widely in human populations as a vector presents additional challenges because vaccine recipients may already have developed an immune response to the vector [@doi:10.3390/vaccines2030624].

There are several viral vector vaccines that are available for veterinary use [@doi:10.3390/vaccines8040680], but prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, only one viral vector vaccine was approved by the FDA for use in humans.
This vaccine is vectored with a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus and targeted against the ebola virus [doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.011].
Additionally, several phase I and phase II clinical trials for other vaccines are ongoing [@doi:10.1128/CVI.00298-16], and the technology is currently being explored for its potential against numerous infectious diseases including malaria [@doi:10.1016/j.ymthe.2016.11.003; @doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.07.035], ebola [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1410863; @doi:10.1093/infdis/jir349; @doi:10.1586/14760584.2014.885841], and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [@doi:10.1097/COH.0b013e328363d389; @doi:10.1016/j.virol.2014.09.004].
The prior MERS and SARS initiated interest in the application of viral vector vaccines to human coronaviruses [@doi:10.3390/v12080861], but efforts to apply this technology to these pathogens had not yet led to a successful vaccine candidate.
In the mid-to-late 00s, adenoviral vectored vaccines against SARS were found to induce SARS-CoV-specific IgA in the lungs of mice [@doi:10.1099/vir.0.81579-0], but were later found to offer incomplete protection in ferret models [@doi:10.1099/vir.0.2008/001891-0].

Around 2014, interest arose in utilizing simian adenoviruses as vectors because of the reduced risk that human vaccine recipients would have prior exposure resulting in adaptive immunity [@doi:10.1038/mt.2013.284], and chimpanzee adenoviruses were explored as a potential vector in the development of a vaccine against _Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_ (MERS-CoV) [@doi:10.3390/v12080861].
In 2017, results were published from an initial investigation of two vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV containing the MERS-CoV S gene vectored with chimpanzee adenovirus, Oxford University #1 (ChAdOx1), a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus [@doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.05.032].
This study reported that a candidate containing the complete spike protein sequence induced a stronger neutralizing antibody response in mice than candidates vectored with modified vaccinia virus Ankara.
It was pursued in additional research, and in the summer of 2020 results of two studies were published.
The first reported that a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS induced an immune response and inhibited viral replication in macaques [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba8399].
The second reported  promising results from a phase I trial that administered the vaccine to adults and measured safety/tolerability and immune response (as indicated through immune assays following vaccination) [@doi:10/ggtxgp].

While not all of these results were available at the time that vaccine development programs against SARS-CoV-2 began, viral vector vaccines have also been explored against this hCoV.

### Discussion

Given the wide range of vaccines under development, it is possible that some vaccine products may eventually be shown to be more effective in certain subpopulations, such as children, pregnant women, immunocompromised patients, the elderly, etc.
However, the vaccine development process has historically been slow, and vaccines fail to provide immediate prophylactic protection or treat ongoing infections [@doi:10.3390/v10120680].
