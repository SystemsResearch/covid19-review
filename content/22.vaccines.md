## Vaccine Development Strategies for SARS-CoV-2

<!--To Do: Add back the Abstract & Importance, potentially with some editing-->

### Introduction

The development of vaccines is widely considered one of the most important medical advances in recent human history.
Over the past 150 years, the approaches available for the development of vaccines have diversified rapidly [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
Since the turn of the millennium, particular interest has emerged in the potential to develop vaccines as a rapid response to emerging threats.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the "swine flu" (H1N1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola all underscored the importance of a rapid global response to a new infectious virus, but the vaccine development process has historically been slow, and vaccines fail to provide immediate prophylactic protection or treat ongoing infections [@doi:10.3390/v10120680].
However, the _Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2_ (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has highlighted a confluence of circumstances that positioned vaccine development as a key player in efforts to control the virus and mitigate its damage.
Examining the vaccine development programs that emerged in 2020 alongside other 21st century efforts to control emerging viral threats demonstrates the significant biotechnological advances in this field.<!--To Do: awkward phrasing--> 

### Historical Vaccine Development
<!--To Do: This first paragraph could probably use a little fleshing out since a lot of it is based on one source, but just to give an idea-->
The first vaccination strategy in human history is widely considered to be the practice of variolation, which makes the history of vaccine development almost 500 years long [@doi:10.1016/j.jinf.2005.07.021; @doi:10.1007/978-1-4419-1339-5_2].
Famously employed as a strategy to improve survival of smallpox by, for example, exposing a healthy individual to pus from a smallpox pustule [@doi:10.1016/j.jinf.2005.07.021; @doi:10.1007/978-1-4419-1339-5_2], variolation carries a number of risks for the recipient [@doi:10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.032].
However, this approach was (debatably) the first example of a live-attenuated virus being used to induce immunity [@doi:10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.032; 10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
Many subsequent efforts to develop live-attenuated viral vaccines relied on either the identification of related zoonotic viruses that are less virulent in humans (e.g., cowpox/horsepox or rotavirus vaccines) or efforts to attenuate the virus through culturing it _in vitro_ [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
This approach still carried risks, however [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
Efforts to overcome the limitations of live-virus vaccines led to the development of approaches to inactivate viruses (circa 1900) and to purify proteins from viruses cultured in eggs (circa 1920) [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
Inactivated viral vaccines still raised some concerns, however, incuding that back-mutations could potentially lead the inactivated vaccines to become virulent or that recombination could occur between the inactivated virus and other viruses in circulation[@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].
Additionally, one of the major limitations of inactivated whole virus vaccines is their susceptibility to lose efficacy due to mutations in the epitopes of the circulating virus [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].
With the increased feasibility of genetic research in the 1980s came the application of genetic engineering to vaccine development, which allowed for the growth of the gene sequences of specific viral antigens _in vitro_  [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
While vaccine development strategies such as live-attenuation and inactivation remain in use in the 21st century [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111], approaches built off of the principles of genetic engineering offer some of the most dynamic opportunities in the field of modern vaccine development.

### 21st Century Approaches to Vaccine Development

![
**Vaccine Development Strategies.**
Several different strategies can and are being employed for the development of vaccines today.
Each approach capitalizes on different features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and delivery through a different platform.
All of these approaches are being explored in the current pandemic.<!--To Do: define LNP, define mRNA, define S protein.

While traditional methods of vaccine development such as inactivated whole viruses are still used today (Figure @fig:vaccines), biomedical research in the 21st century has been significantly influenced by the genomic revolution, and vaccine development is no exception.
Building on the advances in vaccine development that came out of genetic engineering starting in the 1980s, one approach to vaccine development today focuses on the information available in the DNA sequence of a virus (Figure @fig:vaccines).
For example, for DNA vaccines, the sequence encoding the antigen(s) against which an immune response is sought can be cultivated in a plasmid and delivered directly to an appropriate tissue [@url:https://www.who.int/biologicals/areas/vaccines/dna/en/].
<!--To Do: What happens once it's inside? see adenovirus explanation below and make parallel-->
Plasmids are not the only vector that can be used to deliver sequences associated with viral antigens: genetic material from the target virus can also be delivered using a second virus as a vector.
The genetic content of the vector virus is often altered to prevent it from replicating, but replication-competent viruses can also be used under certain circumstances [@doi:10.1016/j.coi.2016.05.014].
The vaccine can then use the host machinery to construct antigen(s) from the transported genetic material, against which the body then synthesizes antibodies in response.
These approaches may offer several advantages over vaccination platforms from before genetics became a staple of biomedical research because these vaccines can stimulate both B- and T-cell responses and lack any infectious agent [@doi:10.1016/j.coi.2016.05.008].<!--To Do: citation for infectious agent?-->
<!-- To Do: host immune response to vector, both or just viral-vector? Alt what are the pros/cons of each relative to the other?-->
Both of these approaches therefore utilize a vector to deliver the DNA sequence of an antigen to the host, where it can be constructed <!--To Do: confirm correct for DNA vaccines-->, triggering an immune response to the antigen specifically without introducing an infectious agent.

More recently, interest has also emerged the potential for viral RNA to induce an immune response (Figure @fig:vaccines).
This approach operates one level above the DNA: instead of directly furnishing the gene sequence associated with an antigen to the host, it provides the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribed from the DNA sequence.
<!--To Do: Two types, self-amplifying and conventional 10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594; 10.1016/j.coi.2016.05.008-->
Prior to 2020, no mRNA vaccines had been approved for use in humans<!--To Do: Cite-->, despite significant advances in the development of this technology [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2017.243].
Some of the potential advantages of mRNA compared to DNA include safety (it cannot be integrated by the host and the half life can be regulated), it avoids any issues of a host immune response against the vector, and it holds the potential to dramatically accelerate vaccine manufacturing and development [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2017.243].
Vaccine development using mRNA is a recent frontier, with challenges in its execution arising from the instability of mRNA molecules, the design requirements of an efficient delivery system, and the potential for mRNA to elicit a very strong immune response [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2017.243].
Current methods in vaccine development can therefore be framed in terms of the central dogma of genetics: vaccines developers are exploring the potential for the delivery of DNA (DNA vaccines and viral vector vaccines), RNA (mRNA vaccines), and proteins (inactivated whole virus vaccines) to induce a host immune response.

### The Pursuit of Rapid, Scalable Vaccine Development

The requirements for a successful vaccine trial and deployment are complex and may require coordination between government, industry, academia, and philanthropic entities [@doi:10.1126/science.abc5312].
The potential of this technology to benefit the field of oncology has encouraged vaccine developers to invest in next-generation approaches to vaccine development, which have led to the great diversity of vaccine development programs [@url:https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/newer-vaccine-technologies-deployed-to-develop-covid-19-shot-67152].
Flu-like illnesses caused by viruses are a common target of vaccine development programs, and influenza vaccine technology in particular has made many strides.
During the H1N1 influenza outbreak, vaccine development was accelerated because of the existing infrastructure, along with the fact that regulatory agencies had already decided that vaccines produced using egg- and cell-based platforms could be licensed under the regulations used for a strain change.
Critiques of the production and distribution of the H1N1 vaccine have stressed the need for alternative development-and-manufacturing platforms that can be readily adapted to new pathogens.
Although a monovalent H1N1 vaccine was not available before the pandemic peaked in the United States and Europe, it was available soon afterward as a stand-alone vaccine that was eventually incorporated into commercially available seasonal influenza vaccines [@doi:10.1056/NEJMp2005630].
If H1N1 vaccine development provides any indication, considering developing and manufacturing platforms for promising COVID-19 vaccine trials early could hasten the emergence of an effective prophylactic vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.-->

### Challenges and Opportunities in Developing a Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 rapidly induced a global public health crisis.
This viral threat did not follow the same trajectory as other emergent viruses of recent note, such as SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and ebola virus, spreading internationally to the point that it was recognized as a pandemic and remaining largely out of control well into 2021.
While, for various reasons, the outbreak of this virus was not controlled as rapidly as in past epidemics, vaccine development technology had also progressed based on these and other prior viral threats to the point that a rapid international vaccine development response was possible.
Unlike many global vaccine development programs previously, such as with H1N1, the vaccine development landscape for COVID-19 includes vaccines produced by a wide array of technologies.
These diverse technology platforms include DNA, RNA, virus-like particle, recombinant protein, both replicating and non-replicating viral vectors, live attenuated virus, and inactivated virus approaches (Figure @fig:vaccines).
Given the wide range of vaccines under development, it is possible that some vaccine products may eventually be shown to be more effective in certain subpopulations, such as children, pregnant women, immunocompromised patients, the elderly, etc.
The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is coordinating global health agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As of September 2020, there were over 180 vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 in development [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2798-3].

The first critical step towards developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was characterizing the viral target, which happened extremely early in the COVID-19 outbreak with the sequencing and dissemination of the viral genome by early January 2020 [@url:https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/] (Figure @fig:virus).

**Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.**
The development of vaccines depends on the immune system recognizing the virus.
Here, the structure of SARS-CoV-2 is represented both in the abstract and against a visualization of the virion.<!--To Do: Add in-line ref-->
The abstracted visualization was made using BioRender [@url:https://biorender.com/] and the microscopy was done by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [@url:https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/novel-coronavirus-sarscov2-images].
](images/SARS_CoV_2.png){#fig:virus secno=1}

For a highly infectious virus like SARS-CoV-2, a vaccine would hold particular value because it could bolster the immune response to the virus of the population broadly, thereby driving a lower rate of infection and likely significantly reducing fatalities.
While little is currently known about immunity to SARS-CoV-2, vaccine development typically tests for serum neutralizing activity, as this has been established as a biomarker for adaptive immunity in other respiratory illnesses [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2022483].
However, unlike in efforts to develop vaccines for prior viral threads, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic has made it possible to test vaccine in phase III trials, where the effect of the vaccine on a cohort's likelihood of contracting SARS-CoV-2 can be evaluated.









### Discussion

However, the vaccine development process has historically been slow, and vaccines fail to provide immediate prophylactic protection or treat ongoing infections [@doi:10.3390/v10120680].
